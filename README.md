# AI-Powered-Adverse-Event-Forecasting-Using-Temporal-Data


## Overview
This project aims to predict **future drug interactions and adverse events** using **temporal data analysis**. By leveraging real-world datasets from **FAERS, ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO ICTRP, and OpenFDA**, the model continuously learns and updates risk levels dynamically. This provides a **preemptive approach** to adverse event detection, allowing healthcare professionals to take action before risks become clinically significant.

##  Key Features
- **Predictive Risk Analysis:** Identifies potential future drug interactions.
- **Time-Series Forecasting:** Uses **LSTM/Transformer-based models** to analyze temporal trends in adverse events.
- **Dynamic Updates:** Integrates real-time FAERS reports for continuous learning.
- **Customizable API:** Provides an interface for querying real-time risk predictions.

## Data Sources
The project utilizes publicly available datasets:

| Dataset | Description | Access | Size |
|---------|-------------|--------|------|
| **FAERS (FDA)** | Reports of adverse drug reactions | [Download](https://fis.fda.gov/extensions/FPD-QDE-FAERS/FPD-QDE-FAERS.html) | 60-140 MB per quarter |
| **ClinicalTrials.gov** | Data on clinical drug trials and reported adverse events | [Download](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/resources/download) | Several GBs |
| **WHO ICTRP** | International clinical trials registry data | [Download](https://www.who.int/clinical-trials-registry-platform/network/who-data-set/downloading-records-from-the-ictrp-database) | 200-500 MB |
| **OpenFDA API** | Live API for real-time adverse event tracking | [API Docs](https://open.fda.gov/apis/drug/event/) | API-based |

## Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Machine Learning:** TensorFlow, PyTorch
- **Data Processing:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
- **Time-Series Models:** LSTM, Transformer models

## Implementation Workflow
### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Data Collection & Preprocessing**
- Download and clean FAERS, ClinicalTrials.gov, and WHO ICTRP datasets.
- Parse JSON/XML/CSV data into structured format.
- Align time-series data for modeling.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Feature Engineering**
- Extract key event timestamps, drug categories, and patient demographics.
- Create aggregated time-series sequences for each drug.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Model Training**
- Train **LSTM** or **Transformer-based models** to forecast adverse event trends.
- Implement **dynamic risk scoring** based on recent event patterns.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Real-Time Data Updates**
- Use OpenFDA API to **ingest new adverse event reports**.
- Continuously update risk predictions.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ **Deployment & API Integration**
- Expose model predictions via **REST API**.
- Create a **dashboard (Streamlit)** for interactive risk assessments.


## Future Enhancements
- üîπ Expand to **multi-modal analysis** (combining clinical notes, imaging, and genomic data).
- üîπ Implement **knowledge graph-based drug interactions**.
- üîπ Enhance model interpretability with **SHAP/LIME explanations**.
